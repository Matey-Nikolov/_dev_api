# Project Setup
This project consists of two parts: a client and a server. Follow the steps below to set up each part.

### 1. Server Setup
The server acts as a bridge between the client application and the rest of the Internet.

### 1.1.  Setup Instructions
Navigate to the server directory (`../server`) in your terminal and install the following packages:

```
npm install cors axios axios-retry express express-rate-limit express-validator helmet
```

### 1.2. Running the Server
```
npm run start
```
Now server is running on port 3000.

### 2. Client application
The client application folder hosts the frontend interface that interacts with the server.

### 2.2 Setup Instructions

In terminal (`../client`) install this packages:

```
npm install react axios react-bootstrap bootstrap firebase react-secure-storage uuid react-router-dom
```

### 2.3 Create .env.local
Configure Firebase by creating a .env.local file in the client directory and adding the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=a
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

REACT_APP_BASE_URL=
REACT_APP_ROLE=
```
***Note: You will receive this configuration separately.***

### 2.4. Running the client application

To run the client application you must be on port 3001. Otherwise you will not have a connection to the server part.
```
npm start
```

## Unit testing

### 1. Backend testing
Navigate to the server directory (`../server`) in your terminal and install the following packages:

```
npm install mocha chai chai-http nock supertest --save-dev
```
When is complete go to (`../server/package.json`) and add or update this:
```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server",
    "test": "mocha './tests/*.test.js'"
  },
```
The test script is configured to run all the **unit tests** located in the tests directory with a - *.test.js extension.

### 1.1 Run the tests
To run backend tests enter following command:
```
npm test
```
